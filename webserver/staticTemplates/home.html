SmartCup was designed to help women with heavy periods. In particular, women with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) tend to have heavy menstrual flows, and there aren’t many products that can help them manage these symptoms.
<br><br>
SmartCup uses the conductance of menstrual blood to sense when the menstrual cup is close to full. It will send a message to the user as a reminder to remove the cup. Through this innovative design, the user doesn’t have to constantly wonder whether or not to take out their cup. They can rely on SmartCup to handle the management of the menstrual cup.

<br><br>As of now, the design is quite primitive, but we plan to have RFID electronics to make the product completely safe. We additionally plan to incorporate an accelerometer to track the angle of the cup to more accurately calculate it’s volume.

SmartCup contains five small copper plates around the inner circumference of the menstrual cup. It also has one plate at the very bottom of the cup. Since menstrual blood has a myriad of electrolytes, it serves as a good conductor of electricity.
<br><br>
When the blood level reaches the upper copper plates, it completes the circuit, and volt meters detect the voltage difference. At this point, it sends its device ID to a server. The server then figures out the phone number of the user, based on their cup’s ID, and proceeds to send them a friendly reminder about the status of their cup.
